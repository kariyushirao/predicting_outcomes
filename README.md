## Predicting Outcomes oTree Code

This repository contains simplified oTree code for Studies 1A and 1B in Rao, K., & Hastie, R. (2020). Predicting Outcomes in a Sequence of Binary Events: Belief Updating and Gamblerâ€™s Fallacy Reasoning. Available at SSRN 3597264.

The only difference between Study 1A, 2A, and 3B is the experimental instructions provided to participants.  The same is true between Studies 1B, 2B, and 3B.  Aside from the experimental instructions, the basic functionality of all six experiments in this research program are represented by the application contained in this repository.

### Version Warning

This application was built on oTree version 2.1.41.  This code is not compatible with later versions of oTree, and will not run if you have a more modern version of oTree on your machine.  

Note that the README_otree.md file contained in this repository maps to oTree version 2.1.41, so the information in that file is outdated (including links and sample code).  Visit the oTree Docs (linked below) to learn more about the oTree platform, and to fine information about the oTree version history.
