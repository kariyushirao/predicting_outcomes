        What's Next: Predicting Analyst Performance
    </h4>

    <p>
        Stock analysts look for trends in the stock market, and use that information to invest their 
        clients' money wisely.  Most stock analysts manage a "book" of stocks, which is a collection 
        of investments they've made for their clients.  Each quarter, analysts will evaluate trends 
        in the market, and decide whether to sell some of the stocks in their book, purchase more of 
        those stocks, or purchase new (different) stocks.  <b>The result of these decisions determines 
        whether the total value of their book increases or decreases in the subsequent quarter</b>.  If 
        an analyst has a successful quarter and the value of his or her book increases, he or she gets 
        a bonus; but if the book drops in value, there is no bonus and sometimes the analyst has to 
        pay a penalty fine.  
    </p>
    <p>
        In this task, you will see the <b>outcomes of investment decisions made by several stock analysts</b>. 
        We will reveal to you, one at a time, the <b><u>change in the value</u> of each analyst's book over the 
        course of eight quarters</b> (2 years).  If an analyst made good decisions in the prior quarter, then 
        you will see the value of that analyst's book go up, if the analyst made poor decisions, you will see 
        the value of that analyst's book go down.  <b><u>After watching what happens</u> to each analyst's book</b> 
        over the course of eight quarters, <b><u>your job is to predict what will happen to the analyst's book 
        in the ninth (next) quarter</u></b>: Do you predict it will go up or down?  After each prediction, we will 
        move on and show you the results for a new, different stock analyst.  This process will repeat 18 times, so you'll 
        see 18 different stock analysts' performance histories in total. <b><u>Remember that each round</u></b> 
        you will see the changes in value of one analyst's book over 8 quarters, and you will make a prediction 
        about how the value of that analyst's book will change in the 9th (next) quarter.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you've completed all 18 rounds, there will be 5 very brief general knowledge questions, and a few questions 
        about yourself, and that will wrap up the HIT.
