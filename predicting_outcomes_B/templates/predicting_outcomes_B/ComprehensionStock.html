        What's Next: Predicting Stock Prices
    </h4>

    <p>
        Stock prices change constantly.  <b>Price movement of a stock reflects the market’s evaluation, 
        and buyers’ and sellers’ expectations of a company’s worth</b>.  Many factors influence stock prices, 
        such as earnings reports, news about a company’s leadership and products, economic policies, 
        and political events.  
    </p>
    <p>
        In this task, you will observe <b>changes in different companies’ stock prices</b>.  
        We will reveal to you, one at a time, the <b><u>change in the value</u> of each company’s stock price over 
        the course of eight quarters</b> (2 years).  If the market evaluates a company’s worth as higher 
        than it was worth the previous quarter, then you will see that company’s stock price go up.  
        If the market evaluates a company’s worth as lower than it was worth the previous quarter, 
        you will see that company’s stock price go down.  <b><u>After watching what happens</u> to each company's 
        stock price</b> over the course of eight quarters, <b><u>your job is to predict what will happen to the company’s 
        stock price in the ninth (next) quarter</u></b>: Do you predict it will go up or down?  After each prediction, 
        we will move on and show you the results for a new, different company.  This process will repeat 18 times, so you'll 
        see 18 different companies’ stock price histories in total.  <b><u>Remember that each round</u></b> 
        you will see the changes in one company’s stock price over 8 quarters, and you will make a prediction 
        about how that company’s stock price will change in the 9th (next) quarter.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you've completed all 18 rounds, there will be 5 very brief general knowledge questions, and a few questions 
        about yourself, and that will wrap up the HIT.
